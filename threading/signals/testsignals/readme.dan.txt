This is a CodeBlocks project, to test the signals in Linux. To test, open a Terminal and enter the following command:

            kill -10 <YourPID>

    Note: the '-10' is the code of SIGNUSR1.


It is counter intuitive, to the Linux 'kill' command (used from a Terminal or a program) can be used to send signal.
use the command 'kill -L' to see all the various types of signal that the kill command can send.
